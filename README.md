# Elsa code challenge

You have a partially complete react-native app that you now need to improve by adding more features.

We will use your additional implementation of our existing app skeleton as a common ground to go deep into tech discussions so feel free to browse around a bit in the existing code and familiarize yourself with how we write react-native at Elsa usin TypeScript, react-navigation, hooks, redux etc.

Feel free to bring in your favorite libs that will enable you to write better and more production ready code.

Please take up to 8h (at most!) to work on this.

Good luck! And have fun!

## Features to be added (the backlog)

These are just examples of features, feel free to come up with your own. And there is no need to finish all of them.

### Your feature

## Environment setup

Instructions on how to setup a React Native development environment can be found here:
https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Make sure to follow the instructions for React Native CLI.

## Installation

```
yarn install
```

### iOS installation

```
cd ios
gem install cocoapods
pod install
```

## Start React Native

NOTE! The React Native Bundler needs to be started on localhost:8081 before running the simulator / emulator. So start the bundler in a separate terminal by running the following command:

```sh
yarn start
```

## Android emulator

```
react-native run-android
```

## iOS simulator

```
react-native run-ios
```
